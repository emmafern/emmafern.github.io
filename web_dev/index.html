<p class="lead">i program for a living.</p>

<p>I am a software engineer at <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a> where I code mostly in Ruby on Rails but I also work across the full stack.</p>

<p>My software engineering career started at <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com">CrowdFlower</a> where I first learned Ruby, and then moved on to Rails. I was encouraged to join a group called Women Who Code that I am still part of to this day. Each Tuesday I meet up with talented women who code in Ruby (among other languages) and we work on whatever we want. In a time and place where there are not many female role models in engineering, I feel this community has been an integral part of my professional development. Recently I also joined a group called ChickTech that fosters technical learning in high school-aged girls so I can do my part in giving back. This experience has, in fact, reinvigorated my interest in maintaining a personal website.</p>

<p>I am available for hire 1 day a week if you have a small project that needs some attention. Contact me at <a href="mailto:emmacolner@gmail.com?Subject=Freelance%20Inquiry">emmacolner@gmail.com</a>.</p>
