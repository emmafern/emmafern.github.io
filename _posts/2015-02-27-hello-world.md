#### It\'s 2015

I thought it was about time that I brought meemoon.com into the 21st century. Welcome to my little slice of the web.

(I don't know what a meemoon is so don't ask.)

Within the past 3 years I made a major career change, from slow-moving academia and a life of doing psychology research on the human brain, to the fast-paced tech world of the Bay Area. I had literally been in school until the age of 30, and then I got my first "real" job at a San Francisco start-up. 

(Don't get me wrong, graduate school and post-doctoral research positions are real jobs with real stress, and much harder workloads in my opinion.) 

Luckily the start-up was small, scrappy and tolerant of folks without much business-savvy. I definitely had none. "You mean, the whole purpose of this, really, is to make money?" It's true. And that's ok. But for so long the idea of working in an office with other "drones" was enough to make me nauseous. That is, until I had to pay NYC rent, and then it seemed to make more sense. I guess that's adulthood though.

Now I am working my way to being a semi-decent web developer at a bigger San Francisco start-up. The city always goes through so much change, and the past few years have been especially intense. Even though I'm a "techie" I know my time in SF is limited. I keep wishing for a second bedroom and even one day owning a home. Alas. #firstworldproblems.

But I digress.

#### The point?

I'm not sure what the point of this blog will be, other than a place for me to write thoughts down about topics that might interest others. I'm hoping it will keep me accountable and encourage me to spend some time each month being a little creative and doing some constructive reflection. I'm going to limit whining and complaining, that's what LiveJournal is for (yes it's still around).

Some topics I'd like to write about include:

- what it is like to be a female programmer
- what it is like to be a junior engineer
- what it is like to be a synesthete
- how to be fashionable if you hate shopping
- forays in photographic experiments
- reviews of hiking trails of the Bay Area
- cooking experiments and food photography
- popular culture reviews (books, tv, music, comics, movies)

Stuff like that. We'll see how far I get.

I'm excited.
