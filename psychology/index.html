  <p>My dissertation is titled <cite title="Source Title">Emotional Modulation of Visual Attention</cite>. There's even a listing for it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-available-066630-Emma-Ferneyhough/dp/1249900433">Amazon</a>, but like most government-funded academic works it is not available to the general public. You can read the abstract <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/34/82/3482879.html">here</a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't show the epigraph, which is kinda my favorite part: </p>

  <p>I was able to co-publish a few other peer-reviewed articles and a book chapter before I escaped, erm, switched careers.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3473146/"><cite title="Source Title">Anxiety modulates the effects of emotion and attention on early vision (2012)</cite></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702873"><cite title="Source Title">Cuing effects of faces are dependent on handedness and visual field (2010)</cite></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470478509.neubb002042/abstract"><cite title="Source Title">Neural Perspectives on Emotion: Impact on Perception, Attention, and Memory (2009)</cite></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17997636"><cite title="Source Title">Dynamics of perceptual filling-in of visual phantoms revealed by binocular rivalry (2007)</cite></a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>I'm still interested in psychology and neuroscience, and love me some good visual and optical illusions. There's a reason I was able to stick with it as long as I did, because on a high level, the human mind and brain are a couple of the biggest mysteries out there.</p>

  <p>Maybe one day I'll write a post about my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">synesthesia</a>.</p>
