<br><font face=helvetica size=2><b>05.12.02:</b> i added special brunch pictures from a week ago.  um, also, i have a lot of pictures of you guys that i don't really want (no hard feelings but i really don't have room for them all).  so come to my room and take them!  i think this is the last update i'll have before the end of the semester.  it's been swell :).  this site will still be up for as long as possible.  oh, i also added some pictures that camille contributed.  they are at the bottom of this page.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>05.01.02:</b> pictures are up from the last room to room.  also, talia has pictures up on the network taken with her digital cam.  go check 'em out :).</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>04.23.02:</b> ummmmm oh yeah, i forgot for a second.  i put up pictures from that 420 party we had...was it last weekend?  hmm.  yeah it must've been.  anywhoo, talia is -indeed- a new photomanager, so i have put up her email address, and a picture of her will come soon.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>04.15.02:</b> special dinner #2 (held on april 13) pictures are up.  in other news i think hadas got recalled, and talia will probably become another photo manager.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>03.09.02:</b> i put up a few pictures from special dinner on march 2nd.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>02.25.02:</b> pictures from the valentine's party on 2/16 are up.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>02.11.02:</b> new pics up from room2room.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>02.05.02:</b> wow, bud bowl has scarred me for life.  just take a look at the pics why don't you?  also some nice ones of the couple hours before the event while some people hung out in the sunshine.
<br>by the way, if anyone has any pics of events that they want on the website, tell me, and i'll put them up (within reason...like not 60 billion cuz i don't have 60 gazibiliion minutes to scan them, hyuk hyuk.  i'm a nerd).  i'll give you credit too.</font><br>
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>01.28.02:</b> hey, i put up two pages of pictures.  one's old from last semester, and the other is from this past week - mostly from friday night.  and that is all.  we are working on gettin the darkroom all set up.  pea soup.</font><br>  
<br><font face=helvetica size=1><b>01.21.02:</b> the first council of the year just happened, and i told dave the address to this place to put in the minutes.  hopefully there will be visitors here.  in any case, there aren't any photos up yet for the semester has just begun.  be patient my little chickadees.  if you wait, they will come.</font>
