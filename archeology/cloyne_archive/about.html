<br><font face=helvetica size=2>emma does all the html and updates.  she uses hotdog pro 6.0 for html editing, adobe photoshop 6.0 for photo editing, and microsoft internet explorer 6.0.  oooh, 666.  don't worry, she's not evil.  her desktop resolution is 1024x768, so if you have smaller (or even bigger) resolution the site may look funkier than it should.  emma is creeped out by talking about herself in the third person so she's going to stop now.
