    <p>I spent my 20s pursuing scientific endeavors. I am spending my 30s as a cog in the machine. The machine is working pretty well for me right now. If money was not a pressing need, I would travel and take photographs a lot of the time, but also probably still spend a lot of time reading books, hiking, cooking and eating.</p>
    <p>I've had some kind of online presence since the mid-1990s when I'd use dial-up to log into Yahoo! chat rooms and hang out with strangers around the world, and when I made my first website on Geocities. Remember those days? The Internet, man. It's a godsend for introverts like me.</p>
    <p>I mostly grew up in California but was born in Malaysia, and have more roots in England. I have also lived in Austin TX, Nashville TN, and New York NY. Moving around is in my blood. Where will I end up next?</p>
    <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, and my Master's and Doctorate in Experimental Psychology at NYU. Then I decided, eh, what the hell, let's be a professional web developer instead.</p>
    <p>I have a <a href="https://dragonlidy.wordpress.com/">mom</a>, a <a href="https://fernlahone.wordpress.com/author/fernlahone/">dad</a>, a younger brother, a younger sister and an older <a href="http://stellarbaby.com/">sister</a> (who by the way designed <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/206407791/hazel-a-handwritten-font">the font</a> I used on the home page). They're all amazing.</p>
    <p>I currently reside in San Francisco, CA with my husband and cat, both snowflakes who I love dearly.</p>
